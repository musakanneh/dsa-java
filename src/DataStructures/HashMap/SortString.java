/***
 * Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:
 *
 * Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
 * Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
 * Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
 * Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
 * Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
 * Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
 * Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
 * In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any
 * occurrence and append it to the result.
 *
 * Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
