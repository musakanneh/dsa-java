/***
 * A split of an integer array is good if:
 *
 * The array is split into three non-empty contiguous
 * subarrays - named left, mid, right respectively from left to right.
 * The sum of the elements in left is less than or equal to the sum of the
 * elements in mid, and the sum of the elements in mid is less than or equal
 * to the sum of the elements in right.
 * Given nums, an array of non-negative integers, return the number of good ways
 * to split nums. As the number may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
