/**
 * Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that
 * starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive).
 * If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
 *
 * For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that
 * starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
 *
 * Return the resulting string.
