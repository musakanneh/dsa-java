 * You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump.
 * In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'.
 * You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:
 *
 * i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
 * s[j] == '0'.
 * Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.
